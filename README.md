# **Optimal Policy for Bernoulli Bandits: Computation and Algorithm Gauge**

## **Official Data Repository**
This the official data repository for the paper "Optimal Policy for Bernoulli Bandits: Computation and Algorithm Gauge" by Sebastian Pilarski, Slawomir Pilarski, and Daniel Varro. It contains close to half a million files with various simulation and computation results. Each file contains values averaged over 1 million simulation runs.

[**Core data**](core_data): 
Core data contains normalized simulation data averaged over 1 million simulations. 

[**Fraction of suboptimal decisions**](fraction_suboptimal): 
Given a full optimal policy table, the data shows what fraction of
the table would be different if decisions were made by a particular algorithm.

[**Rate of suboptimal decisions**](rate_suboptimal): 
This data reports what fraction of decisions a given algorithm makes while playing are suboptimal (i.e., would disagree with the optimal policy).
